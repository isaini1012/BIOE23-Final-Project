# BIOE230-Final-Project

## BIOE230 Final Project DNA biopolymer confinement and escape (molecular confinements)
**README**


### Purpose:
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at simulating the confinement and escape of DNA biopolymers using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The project, part of a bioengineering graduate course, aims to explore the dynamic behavior of DNA molecules at the atomic level using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, specifically focusing on studying the behavior of DNA biopolymers in confined environments. By simulating the dynamic behavior of DNA molecules at the atomic level, we aim to understand how DNA escapes from confinement and the factors influencing this process. This project will provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of DNA molecules, with potential applications in understanding cellular processes and designing DNA-based nanotechnologies.

### Project Overview:
DNA, the most famous biomolecule, is packed into a highly confined space within the cell nucleus. With aging and disease, some DNA might “leak out” of the nucleus through ruptures in the nuclear membrane. This project employs MD simulations to model this phenomenon, using a simplified representation of DNA consisting of "beads" and "springs" to understand the factors influencing DNA escape from confinement.

---

### This project is intended for:

This project is intended for graduate students and researchers in bioengineering, molecular biology, and computational biology, as well as those interested in learning about molecular dynamics simulations and their applications in studying biomolecular systems. It also targets individuals looking to explore DNA behavior under confinement and understand its implications in biological processes.
