## DNA Biopolymer Confinement and Escape (Molecular Dynamics)

### Purpose:
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at simulating the confinement and escape of DNA biopolymers using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The project, part of a bioengineering graduate course, aims to explore the dynamic behavior of DNA molecules at the atomic level using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, specifically focusing on studying the behavior of DNA biopolymers in confined environments. By simulating the dynamic behavior of DNA molecules at the atomic level, we aim to understand how DNA escapes from confinement and the factors influencing this process. This project will provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of DNA molecules, with potential applications in understanding cellular processes and designing DNA-based nanotechnologies.

### Project Overview:
DNA, the most famous biomolecule, is packed into a highly confined space within the cell nucleus. With aging and disease, some DNA might “leak out” of the nucleus through ruptures in the nuclear membrane. This project employs MD simulations to model this phenomenon, using a simplified representation of DNA consisting of "beads" and "springs" to understand the factors influencing DNA escape from confinement.

### Benefits:
- Gain hands-on experience with Molecular Dynamics simulations.
- Understand the dynamic behavior of DNA molecules under confinement.
- Explore the impact of different parameters on DNA behavior and escape.
- Apply knowledge of bioengineering principles to real-world scenarios.

### Key Features:
- Set up a DNA double helix within a confined space.
- Run MD simulations to analyze DNA behavior and escape from confinement.
- Investigate the influence of parameters such as solvent effects on DNA dynamics.
